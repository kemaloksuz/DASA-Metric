# DASA-Metric
DASA is a performance metric for evaluating multitarget tracking filters. 
Basically, it is designed by considering the drawbacks of the conventional OSPA metric.
Also, DASA metric has a structure to quantitively represent the weak/strong properties of the tracking algorithm.
Finally, one can impose more/less weight to a particular component from its components: localization, type 1, type 2 error components.

Please do not hesitate to contact me for any issues about the code or the method itself.
